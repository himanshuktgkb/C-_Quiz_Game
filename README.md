# C++_Quiz_Game
A C++ quiz game project typically involves creating a program that asks the user a series of questions and provides multiple-choice answers. The user selects an answer, and the program checks if it is correct. 
The program keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the quiz. The project is implemented using various C++ concepts, such as classes, functions, loops, and conditional statements.
